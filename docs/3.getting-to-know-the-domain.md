# Getting to know the domain

We will be building a simple service where we can register book authors and let them write books and eventually 
publish them. The publishers though will not be part of our bounded context and we will need to retrieve any 
information about publishers from the publisher API.

In our domain model we have identified two aggregates: Author and Book.
A publisher is information from another bounded context. It might change and we have no control over it as such. 
That is why we make it an immutable value object that is not persisted to our database. The only thing we need to know 
from it is the identifier of the publisher, which we will need in order to identify the publisher of a book.

### The API

```
POST /authors/commands/register
POST /authors/{id}/commands/writeBook
GET /authors

GET /books?title
POST /books/{id}/commands/publish
```

If there are any questions about the domain model or the API definition feel free to ask anybody from codecentric or 
your neighbour.
