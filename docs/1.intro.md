# Expert Workshop Intro
Good to have you at our **"DDD and 'clean hexagonal onion' architecture with Spring"** workshop.
These docs will provide you with a step-by-step guide.

Keep validating your work after every step, the small steps are easier to validate.
In case you got stuck somewhere, feel free to continue the workshop on a code base from one of the prepared branches 
that provide you the solution of each phase.

## Getting Help
Look for someone with a **codecentric shirt**.
Or maybe the person next to you if all codecentric people are very busy helping others.

### What you'll need
- Java 17
- Docker
- An IDE of your choice (ideally IntelliJ)
- an Internet connection

### Time management
There are 6 implementation chapters in total. They become increasingly complex and less guided.
Try not to spend more than 20 minutes on each chapter if you want to have a look at everything.
At the end of each section, there is a git branch reference with which you can continue to the next chapter:

Example:
```javascript
if (allTestsGreen == true) {
    log.info("DONE! Let's move on to the next topic: XXX")}
else{
    log.error("Shout for help!") || (git stash && git checkout 5-persist-author-data-done)
}
```

### Side note
The purpose of this workshop is to get to know the clean hexagonal onion pattern together with a flavour of DDD in 
Spring. I do not intend to have full test coverage in this project, instead only validate the happy flow with an 
integration test or two.
