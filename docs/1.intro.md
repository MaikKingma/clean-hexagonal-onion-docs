# Summercourse intro

Good to have you at our Building a GraphQL service with Spring Boot.
These are the docs that with guide you through setting a Spring Boot service. We will build the basic things we just
discussed during the presentation. The workshop is defined in an example, an exercise and the solution to that exercise.
Finally, when you finished the workshop, it would be good to transform it to a reactive application. You will find out
why during the final discussion.
