# Expert Workshop Intro

Good to have you at our "DDD and "clean hexagonal onion" architecture with Spring" workshop.
These docs will provide you with a step by step guide.

Keep validating your work after every step, the small steps are easier to validate.
In case you got stuck somewhere, feel free to continue the workshop on a code base from one of the prepared branches 
that provide you the solution of each phase.

## Getting Help

Look for someone with a **codecentric shirt**.
Or maybe the person next to you if all codecentric people are very busy helping others.

### What you'll need

- Java 17
- Docker
- An IDE of your choice (ideally IntelliJ)
- an Internet connection
